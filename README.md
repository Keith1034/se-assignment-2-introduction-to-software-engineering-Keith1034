Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.It involves the design,development,testing,deplyoment and maintenance of software products.
It can also be simply termed as a discipline whereby one learns the systematic application  of enginnering principles,methods and tools to the development & maintenance of high-quality software systems.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?It can also be simply termed as a discipline whereby one learns the systematic application  of enginnering principles,methods and tools to the development & maintenance of high-quality software systems.

It differs from traditional programming in that Software enginnering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software,from conception to maintenance with a structured & methodical approach to software development.It also involves software being continuosly refined & improved on user feedback while traditional programming is mainly centered around the code which follows a more linear process where designs are finalized before construction begins. 


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):It is a model that shows you guidelines in phases on how to correctly develop a software.It is well-structured process that helps to document,design,implement,test,deploy and maintain a software system.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
i.Requirements:Gathering & documenting user needs & system requirements.

ii.Design:Creating high-level & detailed designs of the software architecture & user interface.

iii.Implementation:Writing code & building the software according to design specifications.

iv.Testing:Conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards & functional requirements.

v.Deployment:Releasing the software to users or customers.

vi.Maintenance:Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The Agile model is a software development methodology that is an iterative & incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change while the Waterfall model is a software development methodology with a sequential approach with distinct phases such as(Requirements,Design,Implementation)flowing downwards like a waterfall. 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In the Waterfall model,one has to go step by step meaning,for example,one cannot go to the design phase without completing the requirements phase as opposed to the agile model that is iterative,for example,as one is in the testing phase,before concluding,he/she can either jump to continue with earlier/latter phases & then go back to the testing phase,which cannot be done in the waterfall model.

Agile model can be suited for long-term projects while the watrefall method to short-term projects.


Requirements Engineering
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
This is the porcess of gathering & documenting user needs & system requirements.Helps in accurately achieving the software intended purposes,functions & goals in line with user expectations & satisfactions with the right system requirements.


Software Design Principles:
i.Exhibition of uniformity & integration.

ii.Flexibility to changes as per users' needs.

iii.Quality assurance where the quality of the design needs to be checked and focused on.

iv.It should be user-friendly,simplified and easily usable.

v.It should be traceable to the analysis model which means it should satisfy all the requirements that the software requires to develop a high-quality product.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity refers to dividing a software system into separate modules or components where each module handles a specific functionality & operates independently.

Modularity helps in maintainability such that if they are changes needed,they can be made to individual modules without impacting the entire system.

Modularity helps in scalabity in that by breaking down the software into indepedent modules,you can easily adapt,extend or replace parts of the system without affecting others.It greatly assists the system to handle increased loads or adding new features. 


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
i.Unit testing:It uses tests for a single component or unit in software testing and is performed by the developer.It helps validate the performance of unit components.

ii.Integration testing:It invloves combining different software modules & phases as a group to ensure that the integrated system is ready for system testing.

iii.System testing:It helps identify that the system meets the specifications,criteria & also evaluates both functional & non-functional needa for the testing.

iv.Acceptance testing:This kind of testing aims to evaluate whether the particular software system complies with the end-user requirements & if it is ready for deployment.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
A Version Control System is a software tool that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.

It enhances project developement speed by providing efficient collaboration & reduces possibilities of errors & conflicts due to its traceability to every change.

Example:Git 

Features:Track history,distributed development,free & open source.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?





Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software Maintenance is the process of changing,modifying & updating software to keep up with customer needs.

Different types of maintenance activities:
i.Corrective maintenance:This is necessary when something goes wrong in a piece of software including faults & errors.

ii.Preventive:Involves addressing small isssues which at a particular time may lack significance but may turn into larger problems in the future.

iii.Perfective:Aims to adjust software by adding new features as necessary & removing features that are irrelevant in the given software.It keeps software relevant as the market and users' needs change.

iv.Adaptive:These are changes performed toensure a software is rightly adapted in order to meer new requirements & contiue to run well.

Software maintenance is essential in the software lifecycle sinceit helps a piece of software adapt to new changing times,market chnages & demands.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
i.Confidentiality:Engineers should respect the privacy of their clinets & users as they protect their sensitive information.

ii.Conflict of Interest:Enginners should avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest & disclose them to affected parties when they do occur.

iii.Quality Assurance:Professionals should strive to provide high-quality services & products that meet the needs of clients.

iv.Public understanding:Professionals have a duuty to provide accurate information about software systems & their potential impacts.


What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
i.Privacy & Data protection
ii.Intellectual property rights


 How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their
 work?
i.By being trained on legal aspects such as data protection & intellectual property rights.
ii.Incorporating ethics into software engineering curricula that can  equip software engineers with the tools they need to navigate ethical dilemmas.
